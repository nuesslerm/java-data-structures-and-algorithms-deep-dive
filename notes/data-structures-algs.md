data structures
* arrays
* stacks
* lists
* queues
* hashtables
* trees
* heaps
* sets

oranises and stores data
each has strengths and weaknesses

algorithms
* search algorithms
* sort algorithms
* recursion algorithms

steps you have to perform to get a specific result
an implementation is the code that you write to perform an algorithm
* you can implment the same algorithm in multiple different ways

- there can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task
- there can be many implementations of the same algorithm

O(1) constant
O(logn) logarithmic
O(n) linear
O(nlogn) n log-star n
O(n^2) quadratic

arrays:
- contiguous block in memory
- every element occupies the same amount of space in memory 
    - in an array of objects, because what is actually stored in the array is only the object reference, which are all of equal size
- if an array starts at memory address x, and the size of each element in the array is y, we
can calculate the memory address of the ith element by using x + i*y
- if we know the index of an element, the time to retrieve the element will be the same, no matter where it is in the array
- arrays are quite time and memory efficient

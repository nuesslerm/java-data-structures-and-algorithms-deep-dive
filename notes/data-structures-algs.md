data structures
* arrays
* stacks
* lists
* queues
* hashtables
* trees
* heaps
* sets

oranises and stores data
each has strengths and weaknesses

algorithms
* search algorithms
* sort algorithms
* recursion algorithms

steps you have to perform to get a specific result
an implementation is the code that you write to perform an algorithm
* you can implment the same algorithm in multiple different ways

- there can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task
- there can be many implementations of the same algorithm

O(1) constant
O(logn) logarithmic
O(n) linear
O(nlogn) n log-star n
O(n^2) quadratic
